## What is Stream-Checks?

If you are a streamer you know that streaming is more then just clicking on "Go live" and start talking. Often a lot of preparation goes into a stream.
Stream Checks is a small tool to make this routine easier by providing a check-list that contains all important points you need to cover.


## How does it help me?

Set up groups with items that you need to take care of before the stream can start.
For example a group called "IRL" that has items such as "set greenscreen up" and "get a drink".
Each item that is taken care of can be checkmarked and will be crossed off your list.
That way you see exactly what you still need to do and won't forget it.

After you are done: Click on reset list and it will uncheck everything so you can start again for your next stream.

## Installation

It can be installed simply by dropping the project on your webserver and accessing it in the browser.

The project is not persistent yet! This means refreshing the site will delete all created elements and load the default ones.

## Language

Stream Checks is programmed using basic HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.

The [Sortable](https://github.com/SortableJS/sortablejs) project is used for drag&drop support

## Roadmap

- adding drag&drop support for groups
- making group drags includes all items of a group
- adding a save option to a persistent file
- adding save option to the UI
- adding a logo
- adding option to change accent color
- adding "export list" function
